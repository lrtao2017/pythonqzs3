24138171,"Antimicrobial potential of metabolites extracted from bacterial symbionts associated with marine sponges in coastal area of Gulf of Mannar Biosphere, India.",Skariyachan S;G Rao A;Patil MR;Saikia B;Bharadwaj Kn V;Rao Gs J,"Marine coastal areas of India have vast diversity of sponges which harbours many endosymbiotic bacteria which are the source of many potential antimicrobial metabolites. This study focuses the screening and characterization of drug-producing bacteria symbiotically which are associated with marine sponges collected from Gulf of Mannar, South Coast India. Six different sponges were collected and they were identified on the basis of their morphology. The drug-producing isolates were screened by agar overlay method towards various clinical strains. The secondary metabolites were characterized and were found to be quinones, alkaloids, flavanoids and flavonyl glycosides. The metabolites showed significant inhibitory properties against clinical strains that were further identified as chromophoric and fluorophoric in nature. Ethyl acetate extracts of chromophore and floureophore substances showed significant inhibitory properties against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella typhi respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of theses isolates revealed that chomophore-producing strain were closely related to Pseudomonas spp. RHLB12, isolated from Callyspongia spp. and floureophore-producing bacteria was related to Bacillus licheniformis T6-1 which was isolated from Haliclona spp. Hence, our study demonstrated that antimicrobial metabolites extracted from symbiotic bacteria associated with marine sponges have high therapeutic potential against many bacterial pathogens including multidrug-resistant strains.",Gulf of Mannar;chromophoric;endosymbiotic bacteria;fluorophoric;marine sponges;secondary metabolites;therapeutic potential,,10.1111/lam.12178,2014.Mar,Letters in applied microbiology,Bacillus longiquaesitum,58,3,231-41
24137181,Thromboangiitis obliterans in two brothers.,Li QL;He DH;Huang YH;Niu M,"Two brothers (case 1 and case 2) with erythema nodosum were diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). The patients were treated with compounds including Danshen Dripping Pills, Fufang Danshen Diwan and Salvia tetramethylpyrazine. The patients were also treated with fibro-blast growth factor to promote epidermal growth and Bayaspirin enteric-coated tablets to reduce platelet aggregation. The polysaccharide nucleic acid fraction of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and compound glycyrrhizin tablets were taken to improve immune function. Following treatment, case 2 had reduced pain levels in the left foot. The ulcer on the first toe of the left foot had decreased in size, with a reduction in pus secretions and inflammation. Case 1 demonstrated a reduction in pus secretion from the ulcer. However, the area of the ulcer had increased, spreading to the fifth toe with gangrene. A tendon had become exposed on the right foot, which was broken and induced severe pain.",case report;erythema nodosum;thromboangiitis obliterans,PMC3786971,,2013.Aug,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,Bacillus longiquaesitum,6,2,317-320

In one direction, Mn3O4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction Mn3O4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. These two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for Gram positive bacteria, but for Gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. Magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial Mn3O4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (Ms) at low temperature.

24135549,An unholy disease in the Holy Land: the history of anthrax between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea (1909-2012).,Elad D,"The history of recorded cases of anthrax in human beings and animals from 1909 to 2012 in the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is reviewed. The disease was endemic until the middle of the 20th century, but the incidence decreased thereafter, with only sporadic cases from the 1980s onwards. Human cases have not been diagnosed in the region since 1984 and the number of episodes of animal disease has reduced to less than one per year. This decline is mostly due to the disruption of the infective cycle by improved veterinary control, including vaccination, treatment and outbreak management. A policy of reactive vaccination for 10 years of affected herds and herds grazing in their proximity has been applied. No new outbreaks have been observed in such herds after the cessation of vaccination, despite continued grazing on the same sites, so it is assumed that spore survival in such areas is shorter than 10 years. This is independent of the soil composition, which is calcareous throughout most of the relevant area. However, reemergence of anthrax, even after decades, has occurred following disturbance and heavy rainfall.",Anthrax;Historical epidemiology;Holy Land;Human;Veterinary,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.08.031,2014.Mar,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",Bacillus longiquaesitum,199,3,319-23

This decline is mostly due to the disruption of the infective cycle by improved veterinary control, including vaccination, treatment and outbreak management. A policy of reactive vaccination for 10 years of affected herds and herds grazing in their proximity has been applied. No new outbreaks have been observed in such herds after the cessation of vaccination, despite continued grazing on the same sites, so it is assumed that spore survival in such areas is shorter than 10 years. This is independent of the soil composition, which is calcareous throughout most of the relevant area. However, reemergence of anthrax, even after decades, has occurred following disturbance and heavy rainfall.",Anthrax;Historical epidemiology;Holy Land;Human;Veterinary,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.08.031,2014.Mar,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",Bacillus longiquaesitum,199,3,319-23

The vector was transferred into A. tumerfaciens ABI. The thermostable alpha-amylase gene was transferred into Solanum tuberosum L. via Agrobacterium mediation according to the revised method of ZHAO Shu Juan et al (1997) and YANG Mei Zhu et al (1992). Shoots were induced and regenerated on MS medium with 2 mg/L ZT, 0.1 mg/L IAA and 100 mg/L kanamycin. Putative transformants were selected with kanamycin and roots induced on MS medium with 0.15 mg/L IAA. PCR analysis and thermostable alpha-amylase activity assay were done to identify the transgenic plantlets.

12548866,[Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated maize transformation].,Huang L;Wei ZM,"Several maize inbreds were transformed with Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA101 (pGIH). Transgenic maize plants were obtained. Frequency of transformation of maize inbred Suyu No. 1 can reach 8.1%. Results of PCR and Southern blot analysis proved that T-DNA was stably integrated into the genome of maize. Staining with X-gluc confirmed the expression of GUS gene in maize cells. The band amplified by inverse PCR showed that the copy number of transgene in three transformants was single. After long term of subculture, some hygromycin resistant calli lost their regeneration ability. Although Southern blot probed the integration of gusA gene in their genome, GUS activity cannot be detected in those calli. Southern blot analysis of HpaII digest DNA showed that transgenic gusA gene was highly methylated.",,,,1999.Dec,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,32,4,381-9

The percentage of explants which formed buds of cotyledons was about 56%, and that of hypocotyls was about 37%. When the regenerated explants were transferred onto MS medium with 2 i.p. 5 mg/L and NAA 0.1 mg/L for two weeks, whole plantlets were obtained by culturing the regenerated shoots on 1/2 MS medium with NAA 0.1 mg/L. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain (LBA 4404/PBI 121) carrying the GUS gene and Npt II gene was used for transformation. After 2 days of coculture, the hypocotyls and cotyledons were transferred onto regenerated medium containing CP 300 mg/L for bud formation. After 4-5 weeks, the differentiated buds were transferred onto selection medium with CP 200 mg/L and Km 10 mg/L for 1 month, then the green shoots were transferred onto the rooting medium containing Cef 100 mg/L and Km 20 mg/L. 4-5 weeks later, plantlets with Km resistance were obtained and some of them showed higher enzymatic activities of beta-glucuronidase than control ones.",,,,1999.Mar,Shi yan sheng wu xue bao,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,32,1,93-9
12547654,Biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine in bacteria.,Sohlenkamp C;López-Lara IM;Geiger O,"Phosphatidylcholine (PC) is the major membrane-forming phospholipid in eukaryotes and can be synthesized by either of two pathways, the methylation pathway or the CDP-choline pathway. Many prokaryotes lack PC, but it can be found in significant amounts in membranes of rather diverse bacteria and based on genomic data, we estimate that more than 10% of all bacteria possess PC. Enzymatic methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine via the methylation pathway was thought to be the only biosynthetic pathway to yield PC in bacteria. However, a choline-dependent pathway for PC biosynthesis has been discovered in Sinorhizobium meliloti. In this pathway, PC synthase, condenses choline directly with CDP-diacylglyceride to form PC in one step. A number of symbiotic (Rhizobium leguminosarum, Mesorhizobium loti) and pathogenic (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Brucella melitensis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Borrelia burgdorferi and Legionella pneumophila) bacteria seem to possess the PC synthase pathway and we suggest that the respective eukaryotic host functions as the provider of choline for this pathway. Pathogens entering their hosts through epithelia (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) require phosphocholine substitutions on their cell surface components that are biosynthetically also derived from choline supplied by the host. However, the incorporation of choline in these latter cases proceeds via choline phosphate and CDP-choline as intermediates. The occurrence of two intermediates in prokaryotes usually found as intermediates in the eukaryotic CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis raises the question whether some bacteria might form PC via a CDP-choline pathway.",,,,2003.Mar,Progress in lipid research,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,42,2,115-62
12540561,Five-member gene family of Bartonella quintana.,Minnick MF;Sappington KN;Smitherman LS;Andersson SG;Karlberg O;Carroll JA,"Bartonella quintana, the agent of trench fever and an etiologic agent of bacillary angiomatosis, has an extraordinarily high hemin requirement for growth compared to other bacterial pathogens. We previously identified the major hemin receptor of the pathogen as a 30-kDa surface protein, termed HbpA. This report describes four additional homologues that share approximately 48% amino acid sequence identity with hbpA. Three of the genes form a paralagous cluster, termed hbpCAB, whereas the other members, hbpD and hbpE, are unlinked. Secondary structure predictions and other evidence suggest that Hbp family members are beta-barrels located in the outer membrane and contain eight transmembrane domains plus four extracellular loops. Homologs from a variety of gram-negative pathogens were identified, including Bartonella henselae Pap31, Brucella Omp31, Agrobacterium tumefaciens Omp25, and neisserial opacity proteins (Opa). Family members expressed in vitro-synthesized proteins ranging from ca. 26.5 to 35.1 kDa, with the exception of HbpB, an approximately 55.9-kDa protein whose respective gene has been disrupted by a approximately 510 GC-rich element containing variable-number tandem repeats. Transcription analysis by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) indicates that all family members are expressed under normal culture conditions, with hbpD and hbpB transcripts being the most abundant and the rarest, respectively. Mutagenesis of hbpA by allelic exchange produced a strain that exhibited an enhanced hemin-binding phenotype relative to the parental strain, and analysis by quantitative RT-PCR showed elevated transcript levels for the other hbp family members, suggesting that compensatory expression occurs.",,PMC145397,,2003.Feb,Infection and immunity,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,71,2,814-21
12537565,Prediction and overview of the RpoN-regulon in closely related species of the Rhizobiales.,Dombrecht B;Marchal K;Vanderleyden J;Michiels J,"In the rhizobia, a group of symbiotic Gram-negative soil bacteria, RpoN (sigma54, sigmaN, NtrA) is best known as the sigma factor enabling transcription of the nitrogen fixation genes. Recent reports, however, demonstrate the involvement of RpoN in other symbiotic functions, although no large-scale effort has yet been undertaken to unravel the RpoN-regulon in rhizobia. We screened two complete rhizobial genomes (Mesorhizobium loti, Sinorhizobium meliloti) and four symbiotic regions (Rhizobium etli, Rhizobium sp. NGR234, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, M. loti) for the presence of the highly conserved RpoN-binding sites. A comparison was also made with two closely related non-symbiotic members of the Rhizobiales (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Brucella melitensis).",,PMC151178,,2002,Genome biology,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,3,12,RESEARCH0076
12537422,Assessment of screening methods for the identification of genetically modified potatoes in raw materials and finished products.,Jaccaud E;Höhne M;Meyer R,"Qualitative polymerase chain reaction methods for the detection of genetically modified potatoes have been investigated that can be used for screening purposes and identification of insect-resistant and virus-resistant potatoes in food. The presence of the nos terminator from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the antibiotic marker gene nptII (neomycin-phosphotransferase II) was demonstrated in three commercialized Bt-potato lines (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) and one noncommercial GM-potato product (high amylopectin starch, AVEBE, Veendam, The Netherlands) and allows for general screening in foods. For further identification, specific primers for the FMV promoter derived from the figwort mosaic virus, the CryIIIA gene (delta-endotoxin from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. tenebrionis), potato leafroll virus replicase gene, and the potato virus Y coat protein gene, were designed. The methods described were successfully applied to processed potato raw materials (dehydrated potato powders and flakes), starch samples, and finished products.",,,,2003.Jan,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,51,3,550-7
12535615,Characterization of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase homologues of Escherichia coli (YdfG) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YMR226C).,Fujisawa H;Nagata S;Misono H,"Short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase homologues from Escherichia coli (YdfG) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (YMR226C) show high sequence similarity to serine dehydrogenase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We cloned each gene encoding YdfG and YMR226C into E. coli JM109 and purified them to homogeneity from the E. coli clones. YdfG and YMR226C consist of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of 27 and 29 kDa, respectively. Both enzymes require NADP(+) as a coenzyme and use L-serine as a substrate. Both enzymes show maximum activity at about pH 8.5 for the oxidation of L-serine. They also catalyze the oxidation of D-serine, L-allo-threonine, D-threonine, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate. The k(cat)/K(m) values of YdfG for L-serine, D-serine, L-allo-threonine, D-threonine, L-3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and D-3-hydroxyisobutyrate are 105, 29, 199, 109, 67, and 62 M(-1) s(-1), and those of YMR226C are 116, 110, 14600, 7540, 558, and 151 M(-1) s(-1), respectively. Thus, YdfG and YMR226C are NADP(+)-dependent dehydrogenases acting on 3-hydroxy acids with a three- or four-carbon chain, and L-allo-threonine is the best substrate for both enzymes.",,,,2003.Jan,Biochimica et biophysica acta,Agrobacterium tumefaciens,1645,1,89-94
