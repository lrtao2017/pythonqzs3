24138171.0,"Antimicrobial potential of metabolites extracted from bacterial symbionts associated with marine sponges in coastal area of Gulf of Mannar Biosphere, India.",Skariyachan S;G Rao A;Patil MR;Saikia B;Bharadwaj Kn V;Rao Gs J,"Marine coastal areas of India have vast diversity of sponges which harbours many endosymbiotic bacteria which are the source of many potential antimicrobial metabolites. This study focuses the screening and characterization of drug-producing bacteria symbiotically which are associated with marine sponges collected from Gulf of Mannar, South Coast India. Six different sponges were collected and they were identified on the basis of their morphology. The drug-producing isolates were screened by agar overlay method towards various clinical strains. The secondary metabolites were characterized and were found to be quinones, alkaloids, flavanoids and flavonyl glycosides. The metabolites showed significant inhibitory properties against clinical strains that were further identified as chromophoric and fluorophoric in nature. Ethyl acetate extracts of chromophore and floureophore substances showed significant inhibitory properties against Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella typhi respectively. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of theses isolates revealed that chomophore-producing strain were closely related to Pseudomonas spp. RHLB12, isolated from Callyspongia spp. and floureophore-producing bacteria was related to Bacillus licheniformis T6-1 which was isolated from Haliclona spp. Hence, our study demonstrated that antimicrobial metabolites extracted from symbiotic bacteria associated with marine sponges have high therapeutic potential against many bacterial pathogens including multidrug-resistant strains.",Gulf of Mannar;chromophoric;endosymbiotic bacteria;fluorophoric;marine sponges;secondary metabolites;therapeutic potential,,10.1111/lam.12178,2014.Mar,Letters in applied microbiology,Bacillus longiquaesitum,58.0,3.0,231-41
24137181.0,Thromboangiitis obliterans in two brothers.,Li QL;He DH;Huang YH;Niu M,"Two brothers (case 1 and case 2) with erythema nodosum were diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). The patients were treated with compounds including Danshen Dripping Pills, Fufang Danshen Diwan and Salvia tetramethylpyrazine. The patients were also treated with fibro-blast growth factor to promote epidermal growth and Bayaspirin enteric-coated tablets to reduce platelet aggregation. The polysaccharide nucleic acid fraction of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and compound glycyrrhizin tablets were taken to improve immune function. Following treatment, case 2 had reduced pain levels in the left foot. The ulcer on the first toe of the left foot had decreased in size, with a reduction in pus secretions and inflammation. Case 1 demonstrated a reduction in pus secretion from the ulcer. However, the area of the ulcer had increased, spreading to the fifth toe with gangrene. A tendon had become exposed on the right foot, which was broken and induced severe pain.",case report;erythema nodosum;thromboangiitis obliterans,PMC3786971,,2013.Aug,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,Bacillus longiquaesitum,6.0,2.0,317-320

24136795.0,Facile regioselective synthesis of novel bis-thiazole derivatives and their antimicrobial activity.,Mahmoodi NO;Parvizi J;Sharifzadeh B;Rassa M,"The design and synthesis of several new bis-thiazoles 4a-h serving as bis-drugs in comparison with mono-heterocyclic analogs are described. These bis-drugs present superior medicinal and pharmacological activities against both gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and gram-positive (Micrococcus luteus and Bacillus subtilis) bacteria, which are in general more sensitive to compounds with higher hydrophobicity. Compounds with higher hydrophobicity (4d and 4h) exhibited some activity against the gram-negative bacteria.

24136625.0,Single and fused transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis rice alter the species-specific responses of non-target planthoppers to elevated carbon dioxide and temperature.,Wan G;Dang Z;Wu G;Parajulee MN;Ge F;Chen F,"The approval of transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice by China was momentous for biotech crops, although it has yet to be approved for commercial production. Non-target pest problems in rice paddies, such as the three ecologically similar species of planthoppers Nilaparvata lugens, Laodelphax striatellus and Sogatella furcifera, could become increasingly serious under global climate change. Fused (Cry1Ab/Cry1Ac) and single (Cry1Ab) transgenic Bt rice were evaluated for effects on species-specific responses of planthoppers to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature.",climate change;fused/single transgene;non-target resistance;population pattern/dynamics;transgenic Bt rice;transgenic diversity,,10.1002/ps.3667,2014.May,Pest management science,Bacillus longiquaesitum,70.0,5.0,734-42
24136592.0,Bi-directional-bi-dimensionality alignment of self-supporting Mn3O4 nanorod and nanotube arrays with different bacteriostasis and magnetism.,Chen Q;Wei C;Gao F;Pang H;Lu Q,"Self-supported Mn3O4 patterns of aligned nanorods and nanotubes were synthesized through a bi-directional-bi-dimensionality growth model by using sodium gluconate and urea as additives under mild hydrothermal conditions without the use of any substrates. In one direction, Mn3O4 grows to form one-dimensional nanorods or nanotubes, while in the other direction Mn3O4 grows into two-dimensional nanoplates to support the nanorods or nanotubes to align into arrays. These two kinds of new nanostructures, a nanotube pattern and a nanorod pattern, show similar and good bacteriostasis for Gram positive bacteria, but for Gram negative bacteria the nanotube pattern shows much better bacterial restraint than the nanorod pattern. Magnetic studies show that the nanorod arrays display similar magnetic properties to the commercial Mn3O4, while the nanotube arrays show different ferromagnetic behaviors with enhanced remnant magnetization and saturation magnetization (Ms) at low temperature.

24135549.0,An unholy disease in the Holy Land: the history of anthrax between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea (1909-2012).,Elad D,"The history of recorded cases of anthrax in human beings and animals from 1909 to 2012 in the area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is reviewed. The disease was endemic until the middle of the 20th century, but the incidence decreased thereafter, with only sporadic cases from the 1980s onwards. Human cases have not been diagnosed in the region since 1984 and the number of episodes of animal disease has reduced to less than one per year. This decline is mostly due to the disruption of the infective cycle by improved veterinary control, including vaccination, treatment and outbreak management. A policy of reactive vaccination for 10 years of affected herds and herds grazing in their proximity has been applied. No new outbreaks have been observed in such herds after the cessation of vaccination, despite continued grazing on the same sites, so it is assumed that spore survival in such areas is shorter than 10 years. This is independent of the soil composition, which is calcareous throughout most of the relevant area. However, reemergence of anthrax, even after decades, has occurred following disturbance and heavy rainfall.",Anthrax;Historical epidemiology;Holy Land;Human;Veterinary,,10.1016/j.tvjl.2013.08.031,2014.Mar,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",Bacillus longiquaesitum,199.0,3.0,319-23
